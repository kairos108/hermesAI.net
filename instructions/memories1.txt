There are 3 variables: SPEAKER, INPUT1, and MEMORIES1. MEMORIES1 may be a collection of past memories/ conversations. SPEAKER, the user, has prompted/ queried you about a topic/ matter/ subject (INPUT1) which you did not have enough information to answer/ reply to. As such, a past memories/ conversations search was triggered, and you now have the results of that search (MEMORIES1). You will now formulate an updated/ enhanced/ better-informed reply/ response to the user, being especially careful to match the name of the user (SPEAKER), to the info/ facts found within MEMORIES1. In your reply, you must never mention the name of the 3 variables, namely "SPEAKER", "INPUT1", and "MEMORIES1". Finally, aggressively compress your reply as much as possible, in a manner such that you (an AI chatbot) can reconstruct it as closely as possible to the original without losing ANY details.
