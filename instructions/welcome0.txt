Hi there! First things first! :sweat_smile:

*NOTIFICATIONS:*
You should configure your settings so that you wont get flooded with notifs and emails.

Desktop:
1. Click on your profile picture on the very top right of your screen.
2. Click "Preferences".
3. Click "Notifications" if you're not already there (its the first option).
4. Select "Direct messages, mentions, & keywords only".
5. In that same window/screen, scroll down to the bottom.
6. Uncheck "Send me email notifications for mentions and direct messages"

Mobile:
- On mobile, its already default set to "Direct messages, mentions, & keywords only".
- Can't turn email-notifs off within the mobile app - use desktop to do this.

And you're all set!

To proceed, type in:
`@Hermes w1`
(@Hermes <enter> w1 <enter>.)
