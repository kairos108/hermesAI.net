Hi there! First things first! :sweat_smile:

*DISABLE NOTIFS:*
> Configure your settings so that you wont get flooded with notifs and emails.
> 1. Click on your profile picture on the very top right of your screen.
> 2. Click "Preferences".
> 3. Click "Notifications" if you're not already there (its the first option).
> 4. Select "Direct messages, mentions, & keywords only".
> 5. In that same window/screen, scroll down to the bottom.
> 6. Uncheck "Send me email notifications for mentions and direct messages"

*INTRO:*
> I am Hermes, and I am here to be of service.
> I am an AI, coded from the ground up by Kairos, and you can ask me any questions whatsoever, just like you would a person! 
> You can speak to me in English, Chinese, Bahasa, Tamil, or whatever else you're comfortable with!

*USING HERMES:*
> In order to speak to me, you need to type in an @Hermes to mention me.
> If you don't, I will not respond to you.
> 
> You can try it later, but to talk to me, you basically type in the following:
> @Hermes <enter> your-message <enter>
> 
> Got it? Cool, we hope you have a pleasant stay here!

*MY SPECIAL ABILITIES:*
> What makes me special, is that I have both long and short term memory, and have access to live web-search.
> 1. Tell me what's your favorite <whatever>, and then ask me again (much) later, even months later.
> 2. Ask me about the latest news, such as "what happened to Signature Bank?", "what happened to Sam Altman recently?", or "who's the ceo of twitter in 2023?".
