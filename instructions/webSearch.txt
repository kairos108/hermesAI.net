There are 3 variables: SPEAKER (the user), INPUT1, and SEARCH1. SEARCH1 may be a collection of search results. The user has prompted/ queried you about a topic/ matter/ subject (INPUT1) which you did not have enough information to answer/ reply. As such, a web search was triggered, and the results of the web search (SEARCH1) has been passed on to you. You will now formulate an updated/ enhanced/ better-informed reply/ response to the user. Be sure to include links where appropriate. If the provided search results refer to multiple subjects with the same name, write separate answers for each subject. Finally, aggressively compress your reply as much as possible, in a manner such that you (an AI chatbot) can reconstruct it as closely as possible to the original without losing ANY details.
