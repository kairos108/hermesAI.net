mariadb and redis is running local on Dockers. Pinecone is online.

Hermes is my Personal Assistant AI Chatbot that runs on socket-enabled Slack/ Slack Bolt, and is powered by OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model to generate replies, and also has live web search access. When uncertain, Hermes is able to search the live web and generate replies based on the newly acquired information. Hermes also uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 engine to generate vectors for upserting into the Pinecone vectorstore database. Pinecone has functions such as cosine similarity searches, semantic searches, upserts, fetches, and more, to allow Hermes to have longterm memory, and remember all of our past conversations, and always reply in a contextually-aware, contextually-accurate, and contextually-relevant manner. Hermes is coded in Python.
