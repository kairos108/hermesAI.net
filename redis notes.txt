ABOUT REDISEARCH DURABLE/ PERSISTENT MEMORY
----------------------------------------------
My previous suggestion provided separate containers for Redis and RediSearch, whereas my latest suggestion combines them into a single container using the redislabs/redisearch:latest image, which includes both Redis and the RediSearch module. The latest suggestion is more streamlined and easier to manage.

If you want to include RDB snapshots in addition to AOF persistence, you can update the command in the docker-compose-redis.yml file as follows:

The --save 900 1 --save 300 10 --save 60 10000 options configure RDB snapshots to be saved every 900 seconds (15 minutes) if at least 1 key has changed, every 300 seconds (5 minutes) if at least 10 keys have changed, and every 60 seconds (1 minute) if at least 10,000 keys have changed.

AOF (Append-Only File) persistence and RDB (Redis Database) snapshots are two methods used by Redis to store data persistently:

AOF persistence: This method logs every write operation received by the Redis server to an append-only file. The AOF file can be replayed during Redis startup to reconstruct the original dataset. AOF provides better durability compared to RDB snapshots, as it can be configured to sync data to disk more frequently.

RDB snapshots: This method saves a point-in-time snapshot of the Redis dataset to disk. Snapshots can be scheduled at different intervals, depending on the desired data durability. RDB snapshots are more space-efficient compared to AOF and provide faster startup times.

Both AOF and RDB are relevant to this project because they ensure that the data stored in Redis (such as conversation context) remains available even after a server restart, crash, or other disruptions. By enabling both AOF and RDB, you can benefit from the durability of AOF and the efficiency of RDB snapshots.
